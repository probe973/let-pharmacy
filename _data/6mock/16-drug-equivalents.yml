  question: "A patient has been taking 60 mg of hydrocortisone daily by IM injection. Now that they are leaving hospital, they need to be transferred to an equivalent dose of oral prednisolone 5 mg tablets. Given that prednisolone 5 mg = hydrocortisone 20 mg, how many tablets should be supplied for 2 weeks of treatment? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 42
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Daily Dose (Need)** <br />
    Calculate the equivalent daily dose of prednisolone: <br />
    \( \frac{60 \text{ mg (Hydro)}}{20 \text{ mg (Hydro)}} \times 5 \text{ mg (Pred)} = 15 \text{ mg prednisolone daily} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Daily Tablet Count** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \) for 5 mg tablets: <br />
    \( \frac{15 \text{ mg}}{5 \text{ mg}} \times 1 \text{ tablet} = 3 \text{ tablets daily} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Total Supply** <br />
    3 tablets x 14 days (2 weeks) = 42 tablets <br />

    \( \frac{30 \text{ mg (Pred)}}{5 \text{ mg (Pred)}} \times 4 \text{ mg (Methyl)} = 24 \text{ mg methylprednisolone daily} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Daily Tablet Count (Supplied In)** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \) for 4 mg tablets: <br />
    \( \frac{24 \text{ mg}}{4 \text{ mg}} \times 1 \text{ tablet} = 6 \text{ tablets daily} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Total Supply** <br />
    6 tablets x 28 days = 168 tablets <br />
    <br />
    **Answer:** 168

  question: "A 70-year-old patient has been taking 160 mg of hydrocortisone daily by injection. Upon leaving the hospital, they are switched to oral prednisolone 5 mg tablets. Given that prednisolone 5 mg is equivalent to hydrocortisone 20 mg, how many tablets should be supplied for a 7-day course of treatment? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 56
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Daily Dose (Need)** <br />
    Calculate the equivalent daily dose of prednisolone: <br />
    \( \frac{160 \text{ mg (Hydro)}}{20 \text{ mg (Hydro)}} \times 5 \text{ mg (Pred)} = 40 \text{ mg prednisolone daily} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Daily Tablet Count (Supplied In)** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \) for 5 mg tablets: <br />
    \( \frac{40 \text{ mg}}{5 \text{ mg}} \times 1 \text{ tablet} = 8 \text{ tablets daily} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Total Supply** <br />
    8 tablets x 7 days = 56 tablets <br />

  question: "An 84-year-old patient is currently taking 0.75 mg of dexamethasone daily. They are being transferred to oral prednisolone 5 mg tablets for home care. Given that prednisolone 5 mg is equivalent to dexamethasone 0.75 mg, how many tablets must be supplied to complete a 56-day supply? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 56
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Daily Dose (Need)** <br />
    Calculate the equivalent daily dose of prednisolone: <br />
    \( \frac{0.75 \text{ mg (Dex)}}{0.75 \text{ mg (Dex)}} \times 5 \text{ mg (Pred)} = 5 \text{ mg prednisolone daily} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Daily Tablet Count (Supplied In)** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \) for 5 mg tablets: <br />
    \( \frac{5 \text{ mg}}{5 \text{ mg}} \times 1 \text{ tablet} = 1 \text{ tablet daily} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Total Supply** <br />
    1 tablet x 56 days = 56 tablets <br />
    <br />
    **Answer:** 56
