  question: "A 75-year-old man, weighing 58 kg, is admitted to ITU following a coronary artery bypass graft and is prescribed dopamine 3 microg/kg/min IV. Calculate the rate in ml/hr at which a solution of dopamine must be infused to provide this dose if dopamine is administered as a 4 mg/ml solution. Give your answer to one decimal place."
  answer: 2.6
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    58 kg x 3 microg/kg/min = 174 microg/min <br />

    \( \frac{13.32 \text{ mg}}{1.6 \text{ mg}} \times 1 \text{ ml} = 8.325 \text{ ml/hr} \) <br />
    **Answer:** 8.3

  question: "An 84-year-old woman, weighing 46 kg, is admitted with heart failure and is prescribed dopamine 5 microg/kg/min IV. Calculate the rate in ml/hr if dopamine is administered as a 1 mg/ml solution."
  answer: 13.8
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    46 kg x 5 microg/kg/min x 60 min = 13,800 microg/hr <br />
    13,800 / 1000 = 13.8 mg/hr (Need) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \)** <br />
    \( \frac{13.8 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ mg}} \times 1 \text{ ml} = 13.8 \text{ ml/hr} \) <br />
    **Answer:** 13.8
