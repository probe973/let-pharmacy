  question: "A 75-year-old man, weighing 58 kg, is admitted to ITU following a coronary artery bypass graft and is prescribed dopamine 3 microg/kg/min IV. Calculate the rate in ml/hr at which a solution of dopamine must be infused to provide this dose if dopamine is administered as a 4 mg/ml solution. Give your answer to one decimal place."
  answer: 2.6
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    58 kg x 3 microg/kg/min = 174 microg/min <br />

  question: "An 84-year-old woman, weighing 46 kg, is admitted with heart failure and is prescribed dopamine 5 microg/kg/min IV. Calculate the rate in ml/hr if dopamine is administered as a 1 mg/ml solution."
  answer: 13.8
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    46 kg x 5 microg/kg/min x 60 min = 13,800 microg/hr <br />
    13,800 / 1000 = 13.8 mg/hr (Need) <br />

  question: A patient is a 61-year-old female, weighing 61 kg. They are admitted to
    ITU following a coronary artery bypass graft and is prescribed dopamine 8.3 microg/kg/min
    IV for 10 hours. Calculate the rate in ml/hr at which a solution of dopamine must
    be infused to provide this dose if dopamine is administered as a 20 mg/ml solution.
    Give you answer correct to 1 decimal place
  answer: 1.5
  solution: |-
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br /> \( 61 \text{ kg} \times 8.3 \text{ microg/kg/min} \times 60 \text{ min} = 30378.0 \text{ microg/hr} \) <br />
    \( 30378.0 \div 1000 = 30.378 \text{ mg}\) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \)** <br />
    \( \frac{30.378 \text{ mg}}{20 \text{ mg}} \times 1 \text{ ml} = 1.5 \text{ ml/hr} \) <br />

  question: A patient is a 60-year-old female, weighing 54 kg. They are admitted to
    ITU following a coronary artery bypass graft and is prescribed dopamine 6.8 microg/kg/min
    IV for 16 hours. Calculate the rate in ml/hr at which a solution of dopamine must
    be infused to provide this dose if dopamine is administered as a 15 mg/ml solution.
    Give you answer correct to 1 decimal place
  answer: 1.5
  solution: |-
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br /> \( 54 \text{ kg} \times 6.8 \text{ microg/kg/min} \times 60 \text{ min} = 22032.0 \text{ microg/hr} \) <br />
    \( 22032.0 \div 1000 = 22.032 \text{ mg}\) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \)** <br />
    \( \frac{22.032 \text{ mg}}{15 \text{ mg}} \times 1 \text{ ml} = 1.5 \text{ ml/hr} \) <br />

  question: A patient is a 67-year-old female, weighing 64 kg. They are admitted to
    ITU following a coronary artery bypass graft and is prescribed dopamine 7.4 microg/kg/min
    IV for 20 hours. Calculate the rate in ml/hr at which a solution of dopamine must
    be infused to provide this dose if dopamine is administered as a 11 mg/ml solution.
    Give you answer correct to 1 decimal place
  answer: 2.6
  solution: |-
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br /> \( 64 \text{ kg} \times 7.4 \text{ microg/kg/min} \times 60 \text{ min} = 28416.0 \text{ microg/hr} \) <br />
    \( 28416.0 \div 1000 = 28.416 \text{ mg}\) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \)** <br />
    \( \frac{28.416 \text{ mg}}{11 \text{ mg}} \times 1 \text{ ml} = 2.6 \text{ ml/hr} \) <br />

  question: A patient is a 71-year-old male, weighing 63 kg. They are admitted to
    ITU following a coronary artery bypass graft and is prescribed dopamine 4.7 microg/kg/min
    IV for 15 hours. Calculate the rate in ml/hr at which a solution of dopamine must
    be infused to provide this dose if dopamine is administered as a 5 mg/ml solution.
    Give you answer correct to 1 decimal place
  answer: 3.6
  solution: |-
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br /> \( 63 \text{ kg} \times 4.7 \text{ microg/kg/min} \times 60 \text{ min} = 17766.0 \text{ microg/hr} \) <br />
    \( 17766.0 \div 1000 = 17.766 \text{ mg}\) <br />

  question: A patient is a 64-year-old female, weighing 69 kg. They are admitted to
    ITU following a coronary artery bypass graft and is prescribed dopamine 3.7 microg/kg/min
    IV for 14 hours. Calculate the rate in ml/hr at which a solution of dopamine must
    be infused to provide this dose if dopamine is administered as a 4 mg/ml solution.
    Give you answer correct to 1 decimal place
  answer: 3.8
  solution: |-
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br /> \( 69 \text{ kg} \times 3.7 \text{ microg/kg/min} \times 60 \text{ min} = 15318.0 \text{ microg/hr} \) <br />
