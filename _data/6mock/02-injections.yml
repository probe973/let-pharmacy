  question: "A 12-year-old girl weighing 39 kg has been prescribed amoxicillin 50 mg/kg QDS for suspected endocarditis. The displacement volume for the 1000 mg amoxicillin vial is 0.8 mL. Each vial needs to be reconstituted with 20 mL of water for injection. How many millilitres of amoxicillin injection need to be given for each prescribed dose? Give your answer to one decimal place."
  answer: 40.6
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br /> 39 kg x 50 mg/kg = 1,950 mg <br />
    **Step 2: Volume required** <br /> Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Volume} \): <br />
    Total volume = 20 mL + 0.8 mL = 20.8 mL <br />
    \( \frac{1,950 \text{ mg}}{1,000 \text{ mg}} \times 20.8 \text{ mL} = 40.56 \text{ mL} \) <br />
