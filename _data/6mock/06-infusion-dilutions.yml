  question: "A 52-year-old man weighing 65 kg is diagnosed with osteomyelitis and started on meropenem 20 mg/kg as an infusion every 8 hours. You have 1 g meropenem vials available which are reconstituted with 20 mL of water for injection and then further diluted to a 5 mg/mL infusion with 0.9% sodium chloride. What is the total number of millilitres of 0.9% sodium chloride that should be added to the meropenem for each dose? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 234
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    65 kg x 20 mg/kg = 1,300 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate volume of reconstituted drug** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \): <br />
    \( \frac{1,300 \text{ mg}}{1,000 \text{ mg}} \times 20 \text{ mL} = 26 \text{ mL} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Calculate total final volume of infusion** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \): <br />
    \( \frac{1,300 \text{ mg}}{5 \text{ mg}} \times 1 \text{ mL} = 260 \text{ mL} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 4: Calculate volume of 0.9% sodium chloride to add** <br />
    260 mL (Total) - 26 mL (Drug) = 234 mL <br />
