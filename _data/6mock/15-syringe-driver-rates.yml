  question: "A patient is prescribed midazolam 25 mg to be given in a syringe driver over 24 hours. You supply the 10 mg/2 mL midazolam ampoules which need to be made up to a final volume of 18 mL with water for injection in the syringe driver. What rate should the infusion be set at in mL/hour? Give your answer to two decimal places."
  answer: 0.75
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \) to find the drug volume: <br />
    \( \frac{25 \text{ mg}}{10 \text{ mg}} \times 2 \text{ mL} = 5 \text{ mL of midazolam} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Total volume in syringe** <br />
    The question states the final volume is made up to 18 mL. <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Calculate the infusion rate** <br />
    Rate (mL/hr) = \( \frac{\text{Total Volume}}{\text{Time}} \) <br />
    \( \frac{18 \text{ mL}}{24 \text{ hours}} = 0.75 \text{ mL/hr} \) <br />

    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \): <br />
    \( \frac{50 \text{ mg}}{10 \text{ mg}} \times 1 \text{ mL} = 5 \text{ mL of morphine sulfate} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Total volume in syringe** <br />
    The final volume in the syringe driver is 30 mL. <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Calculate the infusion rate** <br />
    Rate (mL/hr) = \( \frac{30 \text{ mL}}{24 \text{ hours}} = 1.25 \text{ mL/hr} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Answer:** 1.25

  question: "A 39-year-old patient is prescribed cyclizine 150 mg to be given in a syringe driver over 24 hours. The available ampoules are 50 mg/mL. The medication needs to be made up to a final volume of 48 mL with water for injection. What rate should the infusion be set at in mL/hour? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 2
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \): <br />
    \( \frac{150 \text{ mg}}{50 \text{ mg}} \times 1 \text{ mL} = 3 \text{ mL of cyclizine} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Total volume in syringe** <br />
    The final volume in the syringe driver is 48 mL. <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Calculate the infusion rate** <br />
    Rate (mL/hr) = \( \frac{48 \text{ mL}}{24 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ mL/hr} \) <br />

  question: "A 51-year-old patient is prescribed oxycodone 10 mg to be given in a syringe driver over 24 hours. The dispensary supplies 10 mg/mL ampoules. The medication is to be made up to a final volume of 12 mL with 0.9% sodium chloride. What rate should the infusion be set at in mL/hour? Give your answer to one decimal place."
  answer: 0.5
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \): <br />
    \( \frac{10 \text{ mg}}{10 \text{ mg}} \times 1 \text{ mL} = 1 \text{ mL of oxycodone} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Total volume in syringe** <br />
    The final volume in the syringe driver is 12 mL. <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Calculate the infusion rate** <br />
    Rate (mL/hr) = \( \frac{12 \text{ mL}}{24 \text{ hours}} = 0.5 \text{ mL/hr} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Answer:** 0.5
