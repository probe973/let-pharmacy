  question: "A patient is prescribed midazolam 25 mg to be given in a syringe driver over 24 hours. You supply the 10 mg/2 mL midazolam ampoules which need to be made up to a final volume of 18 mL with water for injection in the syringe driver. What rate should the infusion be set at in mL/hour? Give your answer to two decimal places."
  answer: 0.75
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Identify the final volume and duration** <br />
    Final total volume = 18 mL <br />
    Total time = 24 hours <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate the infusion rate** <br />
    Rate (mL/hr) = Total Volume / Total Time <br />
    \( 18 \text{ mL} / 24 \text{ hours} = 0.75 \text{ mL/hr} \) <br />
