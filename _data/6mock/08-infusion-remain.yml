  question: "A 46-year-old woman weighing 70 kg is prescribed an infusion of Immunoglobulin 10% at a dose of 0.4 g/kg. The infusion rate is set at 0.5 mL/kg/hr for 15 mins, then 1.0 mL/kg/hr for 30 mins, then 2.0 mL/kg/hr for 45 minutes, and finally 4.0 mL/kg/hr for the remainder of the infusion. What is the total infusion duration in minutes if it is infused at the prescribed rate? Round your answer up to the nearest whole minute."
  answer: 119
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    Total drug needed: 70 kg x 0.4 g/kg = 28 g <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Total Volume (Supplied In)** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \): <br />
    \( \frac{28 \text{ g}}{10 \text{ g}} \times 100 \text{ mL} = 280 \text{ mL} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Volume delivered in timed phases** <br />
    Phase 1 (15m): 0.5 mL/kg/hr x 70 kg x 0.25 hr = 8.75 mL <br />
    Phase 2 (30m): 1.0 mL/kg/hr x 70 kg x 0.5 hr = 35.0 mL <br />
    Phase 3 (45m): 2.0 mL/kg/hr x 70 kg x 0.75 hr = 105.0 mL <br />
    Total volume delivered in phases = 148.75 mL <br />
    <br />
    **Step 4: Remainder duration and total time** <br />
    Remaining volume: 280 mL - 148.75 mL = 131.25 mL <br />
    Final rate: 4.0 mL/kg/hr x 70 kg = 280 mL/hr <br />
    Remainder time: \( \frac{131.25 \text{ mL}}{280 \text{ mL/hr}} \times 60 \text{ mins} = 28.125 \text{ mins} \) <br />
    Total duration: 15 + 30 + 45 + 28.125 = 118.125 minutes <br />

  question: "A 62-year-old man weighing 80 kg is prescribed an infusion of Immunoglobulin 5% at a dose of 0.3 g/kg. The infusion rate is set at 1.0 mL/kg/hr for 30 mins, then 2.0 mL/kg/hr for 15 mins, then 3.0 mL/kg/hr for 60 minutes, and finally 5.0 mL/kg/hr for the remainder. What is the total infusion duration in minutes? Round your answer up to the nearest whole minute."
  answer: 129
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    Total drug needed: 80 kg x 0.3 g/kg = 24 g <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Total Volume (Supplied In)** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \): <br />
    \( \frac{24 \text{ g}}{5 \text{ g}} \times 100 \text{ mL} = 480 \text{ mL} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Volume delivered in timed phases** <br />
    Phase 1 (30m): 1.0 mL/kg/hr x 80 kg x 0.5 hr = 40.0 mL <br />
    Phase 2 (15m): 2.0 mL/kg/hr x 80 kg x 0.25 hr = 40.0 mL <br />
    Phase 3 (60m): 3.0 mL/kg/hr x 80 kg x 1.0 hr = 240.0 mL <br />
    Total volume delivered in phases = 320.0 mL <br />
    <br />
    **Step 4: Remainder duration and total time** <br />
    Remaining volume: 480 mL - 320.0 mL = 160.0 mL <br />
    Final rate: 5.0 mL/kg/hr x 80 kg = 400 mL/hr <br />
    Remainder time: \( \frac{160.0 \text{ mL}}{400 \text{ mL/hr}} \times 60 \text{ mins} = 24.0 \text{ mins} \) <br />
    Total duration: 30 + 15 + 60 + 24 = 129 minutes <br />

What is the total infusion duration in minutes? Round your answer up to the nearest whole minute."
  answer: 162
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    90 kg x 0.5 g/kg = 45 g <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Total Volume (Supplied In)** <br />

    Total volume delivered in phases = 213.75 mL <br />
    <br />
    **Step 4: Remainder duration and total time** <br />
    Remaining volume: 450 mL - 213.75 mL = 236.25 mL <br />
    Final rate: 6.0 x 90 = 540 mL/hr <br />
    Remainder time: \( \frac{236.25 \text{ mL}}{540 \text{ mL/hr}} \times 60 \text{ mins} = 26.25 \text{ mins} \) <br />

  answer: 443
  solution: |-
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    \( 67 \text{ kg} \times 0.3 \text{ g/kg} =  20 \text{ g} \)<br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Total Volume** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \): <br />
    \( \frac{20 \text{ g}}{3 \text{ g}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 666.67 \text{ ml} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Volume delivered in timed phases** <br />
    Phase 1 (45 mins): \(0.6 \text{ mL/kg/hr} \times 67 \text{ kg} \times 0.75 \text{ hr} = 30.15 \text{ mL} \) <br />

    Total volume delivered in phases = 254.6 mL <br />

    **Step 4: Remainder duration and total time** <br />
    Remaining volume: \( 666.67-254.6 = 412.07 \text{ mL}  \) <br />
    Final rate: \( 1.2 \text{ mL/kg/hr} \times 67 \text{ kg} = 80.4 \text{ mL/hr} \) <br />
    Remainder time: \( \frac{412.07 \text{ mL}}{80.4 \text{ mL/hr}} \times 60 \text{ mins} = 307.515 \text{ mins} \) <br />

  solution: |-
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    \( 65 \text{ kg} \times 1.3 \text{ g/kg} =  84 \text{ g} \)<br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Total Volume** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \): <br />
    \( \frac{84 \text{ g}}{20 \text{ g}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 420.0 \text{ ml} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Volume delivered in timed phases** <br />
    Phase 1 (90 mins): \(2.3 \text{ mL/kg/hr} \times 65 \text{ kg} \times 1.5 \text{ hr} = 224.25 \text{ mL} \) <br />
    Phase 1 (90 mins): \(1.0 \text{ mL/kg/hr} \times 65 \text{ kg} \times 1.5 \text{ hr} = 97.5 \text{ mL} \) <br />
    Phase 1 (15 mins): \(1.8 \text{ mL/kg/hr} \times 65 \text{ kg} \times 0.25 \text{ hr} = 29.25 \text{ mL} \) <br />
    Total volume delivered in phases = 351.0 mL <br />
    <br />
    **Step 4: Remainder duration and total time** <br />
    Remaining volume: \( 420.0-351.0 = 69.0 \text{ mL}  \) <br />
    Final rate: \( 1.2 \text{ mL/kg/hr} \times 65 \text{ kg} = 78.0 \text{ mL/hr} \) <br />
    Remainder time: \( \frac{69.0 \text{ mL}}{78.0 \text{ mL/hr}} \times 60 \text{ mins} = 53.077 \text{ mins} \) <br />
    Total duration: \(90 + 90 + 15 + 53.077 = 248.077 \text{ mins} \) <br />

    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    \( 59 \text{ kg} \times 0.6 \text{ g/kg} =  35 \text{ g} \)<br />

    **Step 2: Total Volume** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \): <br />

    **Step 4: Remainder duration and total time** <br />
    Remaining volume: \( 437.5-206.5 = 231.0 \text{ mL}  \) <br />
    Final rate: \( 2.2 \text{ mL/kg/hr} \times 59 \text{ kg} = 129.8 \text{ mL/hr} \) <br />
    Remainder time: \( \frac{231.0 \text{ mL}}{129.8 \text{ mL/hr}} \times 60 \text{ mins} = 106.78 \text{ mins} \) <br />
