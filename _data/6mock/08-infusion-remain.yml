  question: "A 46-year-old woman weighing 70 kg is prescribed an infusion of Immunoglobulin 10% at a dose of 0.4 g/kg. The infusion rate is set at 0.5 mL/kg/hr for 15 mins, then 1.0 mL/kg/hr for 30 mins, then 2.0 mL/kg/hr for 45 minutes, and finally 4.0 mL/kg/hr for the remainder of the infusion. What is the total infusion duration in minutes if it is infused at the prescribed rate? Round your answer up to the nearest whole minute."
  answer: 119
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    Total drug needed: 70 kg x 0.4 g/kg = 28 g <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Total Volume (Supplied In)** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \): <br />
    \( \frac{28 \text{ g}}{10 \text{ g}} \times 100 \text{ mL} = 280 \text{ mL} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Volume delivered in timed phases** <br />
    Phase 1 (15m): 0.5 mL/kg/hr x 70 kg x 0.25 hr = 8.75 mL <br />
    Phase 2 (30m): 1.0 mL/kg/hr x 70 kg x 0.5 hr = 35.0 mL <br />
    Phase 3 (45m): 2.0 mL/kg/hr x 70 kg x 0.75 hr = 105.0 mL <br />
    Total volume delivered in phases = 148.75 mL <br />
    <br />
    **Step 4: Remainder duration and total time** <br />
    Remaining volume: 280 mL - 148.75 mL = 131.25 mL <br />
    Final rate: 4.0 mL/kg/hr x 70 kg = 280 mL/hr <br />
    Remainder time: \( \frac{131.25 \text{ mL}}{280 \text{ mL/hr}} \times 60 \text{ mins} = 28.125 \text{ mins} \) <br />
    Total duration: 15 + 30 + 45 + 28.125 = 118.125 minutes <br />

  question: "A 62-year-old man weighing 80 kg is prescribed an infusion of Immunoglobulin 5% at a dose of 0.3 g/kg. The infusion rate is set at 1.0 mL/kg/hr for 30 mins, then 2.0 mL/kg/hr for 15 mins, then 3.0 mL/kg/hr for 60 minutes, and finally 5.0 mL/kg/hr for the remainder. What is the total infusion duration in minutes? Round your answer up to the nearest whole minute."
  answer: 129
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    Total drug needed: 80 kg x 0.3 g/kg = 24 g <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Total Volume (Supplied In)** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \): <br />
    \( \frac{24 \text{ g}}{5 \text{ g}} \times 100 \text{ mL} = 480 \text{ mL} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Volume delivered in timed phases** <br />
    Phase 1 (30m): 1.0 mL/kg/hr x 80 kg x 0.5 hr = 40.0 mL <br />
    Phase 2 (15m): 2.0 mL/kg/hr x 80 kg x 0.25 hr = 40.0 mL <br />
    Phase 3 (60m): 3.0 mL/kg/hr x 80 kg x 1.0 hr = 240.0 mL <br />
    Total volume delivered in phases = 320.0 mL <br />
    <br />
    **Step 4: Remainder duration and total time** <br />
    Remaining volume: 480 mL - 320.0 mL = 160.0 mL <br />
    Final rate: 5.0 mL/kg/hr x 80 kg = 400 mL/hr <br />
    Remainder time: \( \frac{160.0 \text{ mL}}{400 \text{ mL/hr}} \times 60 \text{ mins} = 24.0 \text{ mins} \) <br />
    Total duration: 30 + 15 + 60 + 24 = 129 minutes <br />

What is the total infusion duration in minutes? Round your answer up to the nearest whole minute."
  answer: 162
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    90 kg x 0.5 g/kg = 45 g <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Total Volume (Supplied In)** <br />

    Total volume delivered in phases = 213.75 mL <br />
    <br />
    **Step 4: Remainder duration and total time** <br />
    Remaining volume: 450 mL - 213.75 mL = 236.25 mL <br />
    Final rate: 6.0 x 90 = 540 mL/hr <br />
    Remainder time: \( \frac{236.25 \text{ mL}}{540 \text{ mL/hr}} \times 60 \text{ mins} = 26.25 \text{ mins} \) <br />

    **Step 2: **Step 2: Total Volume** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \): <br />
    \( \frac{91 \text{ g}}{20 \text{ g}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 455.0 \text{ ml} \) <br />

  answer: 289
  solution: |-
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    \( 72 \text{ kg} \times 1.1 \text{ g\kg} =  79 \text{ g} \)<br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: **Step 2: Total Volume** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \): <br />
    \( \frac{79 \text{ g}}{11 \text{ g}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 718.18 \text{ ml} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Volume delivered in timed phases** <br />
    Phase 1 (15 mins): \(2.0 \text{ mL/kg/hr} \times 72 \text{ kg} \times 0.25 \text{ hr} = 36.0 \text{ mL} \) <br />
    Phase 1 (30 mins): \(2.1 \text{ mL/kg/hr} \times 72 \text{ kg} \times 0.5 \text{ hr} = 75.6 \text{ mL} \) <br />
    Phase 1 (60 mins): \(2.0 \text{ mL/kg/hr} \times 72 \text{ kg} \times 1.0 \text{ hr} = 144.0 \text{ mL} \) <br />
    Total volume delivered in phases = 255.6 mL <br />
    <br />
    **Step 4: Remainder duration and total time** <br />
    Remaining volume: \( 718.18-255.6 = 462.58 \text{ mL}  \) <br />
    Final rate: \( 2.1 \text{ mL/kg/hr} \times 72 \text{ kg} = 151.2 \text{ mL/hr} \) <br />
    Remainder time: \( \frac{462.58 \text{ mL}}{151.2 \text{ mL/hr}} \times 60 \text{ mins} = 183.563 \text{ mins} \) <br />

    **Step 2: **Step 2: Total Volume** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \): <br />
    \( \frac{80 \text{ g}}{18 \text{ g}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 444.44 \text{ ml} \) <br />

  answer: 316
  solution: |-
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    \( 64 \text{ kg} \times 0.5 \text{ g\kg} =  32 \text{ g} \)<br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: **Step 2: Total Volume** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \): <br />
    \( \frac{32 \text{ g}}{8 \text{ g}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 400.0 \text{ ml} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Volume delivered in timed phases** <br />
    Phase 1 (15 mins): \(1.7 \text{ mL/kg/hr} \times 64 \text{ kg} \times 0.25 \text{ hr} = 27.2 \text{ mL} \) <br />

  answer: 147
  solution: |-
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />

    <br />
    **Step 2: **Step 2: Total Volume** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \): <br />
    \( \frac{30 \text{ g}}{19 \text{ g}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 157.89 \text{ ml} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Volume delivered in timed phases** <br />
    Phase 1 (30 mins): \(1.2 \text{ mL/kg/hr} \times 50 \text{ kg} \times 0.5 \text{ hr} = 30.0 \text{ mL} \) <br />

    **Step 4: Remainder duration and total time** <br />
    Remaining volume: \( 157.89-147.5 = 10.39 \text{ mL}  \) <br />

    \ rate: <br />\n2.2 mL/kg/hr for 90 mins, <br />\nthen 0.7 mL/kg/hr for 30 mins,\

    \ of the infusion. <br />\nWhat is the total infusion duration in minutes, if\
    \ it is infused at the given rate? Round your answer to the nearest whole minute."
  answer: 274
  solution: |-
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    \( 75 \text{ kg} \times 0.5 \text{ g\kg} =  38 \text{ g} \)<br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: **Step 2: Total Volume** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \): <br />
    \( \frac{38 \text{ g}}{7 \text{ g}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 542.86 \text{ ml} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Volume delivered in timed phases** <br />
    Phase 1 (90 mins): \(2.2 \text{ mL/kg/hr} \times 75 \text{ kg} \times 1.5 \text{ hr} = 247.5 \text{ mL} \) <br />
    Phase 1 (30 mins): \(0.7 \text{ mL/kg/hr} \times 75 \text{ kg} \times 0.5 \text{ hr} = 26.25 \text{ mL} \) <br />
    Phase 1 (90 mins): \(1.4 \text{ mL/kg/hr} \times 75 \text{ kg} \times 1.5 \text{ hr} = 157.5 \text{ mL} \) <br />
    Total volume delivered in phases = 431.25 mL <br />
    <br />
    **Step 4: Remainder duration and total time** <br />
    Remaining volume: \( 542.86-431.25 = 111.61 \text{ mL}  \) <br />
    Final rate: \( 1.4 \text{ mL/kg/hr} \times 75 \text{ kg} = 105.0 \text{ mL/hr} \) <br />
    Remainder time: \( \frac{111.61 \text{ mL}}{105.0 \text{ mL/hr}} \times 60 \text{ mins} = 63.777 \text{ mins} \) <br />
    Total duration: \(90 + 30 + 90 + 63.777 = 273.777 \text{ mins} \) <br />

    **Step 4: Remainder duration and total time** <br />
    Remaining volume: \( 415.38-265.95 = 149.43 \text{ mL}  \) <br />
    Final rate: \( 2.4 \text{ mL/kg/hr} \times 54 \text{ kg} = 129.6 \text{ mL/hr} \) <br />
    Remainder time: \( \frac{149.43 \text{ mL}}{129.6 \text{ mL/hr}} \times 60 \text{ mins} = 69.181 \text{ mins} \) <br />
