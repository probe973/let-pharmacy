    Current dose: \(50 \text{ mL} \times 15 \text{ mg/mL} = 750 \text{ mg} \) <br />
    \( \text{Target Absorbed} = 600.0 \text{ mg} \times 0.8 = 600.0 \text{ mg} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate equivalent new dose** <br />
    \( \text{New Dose} = 600.0 \text{ mg} \div 0.85 = 705.9 \text{ mg} \) <br />

  question: A patient is transitioning from a liquid medication to a tablet to assist
    with medication compliance. The current dose is 5 mL of a 7.5 mg/mL liquid daily
    ( \( F = 0.9) \). What is the equivalent dose of the tablet ( \( F = 0.95) \),
    in milligrams, to providing the equivalent dose? Round your answer to the nearest
    25 mg.
  answer: 25
  solution: |-
    **Step 1: Calculate amount currently absorbed (Target)** <br />
    Current dose: \(5 \text{ mL} \times 7.5 \text{ mg/mL} = 38 \text{ mg} \) <br />
    \( \text{Target Absorbed} = 34.2 \text{ mg} \times 0.9 = 34.2 \text{ mg} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate equivalent new dose** <br />
    \( \text{New Dose} = 34.2 \text{ mg} \div 0.95 = 36.0 \text{ mg} \) <br />

  question: A patient is transitioning from a liquid medication to a tablet to assist
    with medication compliance. The current dose is 40 mL of a 5 mg/mL liquid daily
    ( \( F = 0.7) \). What is the equivalent dose of the tablet ( \( F = 0.75) \),
    in milligrams, to providing the equivalent dose? Round your answer to the nearest
    25 mg.
  answer: 175
  solution: |-
    **Step 1: Calculate amount currently absorbed (Target)** <br />
    Current dose: \(40 \text{ mL} \times 5 \text{ mg/mL} = 200 \text{ mg} \) <br />
    \( \text{Target Absorbed} = 140.0 \text{ mg} \times 0.7 = 140.0 \text{ mg} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate equivalent new dose** <br />
    \( \text{New Dose} = 140.0 \text{ mg} \div 0.75 = 186.7 \text{ mg} \) <br />
