  question: "A 52-year-old patient has a prescription for warfarin tablets with the directions 'Take 4 mg and 5 mg on alternating days', but the quantity is missing. You have 1 mg and 3 mg warfarin tablets available to make up the required dose. Assuming that the patient's INR remains stable and within the acceptable range for their condition, what is the exact number of warfarin 1 mg tablets that would be required for a 28-day supply alongside the sufficient supply of 3 mg tablets? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 42
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Determine 1 mg tablets needed per dose** <br />
    To minimize the total tablet count, the 3 mg strength is used as the base. <br />
    - On 4 mg days: One 3 mg tablet + One 1 mg tablet are required. <br />
    - On 5 mg days: One 3 mg tablet + Two 1 mg tablets are required. <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate for the 28-day period (14 days of each dose)** <br />
    - 1 mg tablets for 4 mg days: 1 tablet x 14 days = 14 tablets. <br />
    - 1 mg tablets for 5 mg days: 2 tablets x 14 days = 28 tablets. <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Calculate total 1 mg tablets** <br />
    14 tablets + 28 tablets = 42 tablets. <br />

  question: "A 52-year-old patient has a prescription for warfarin tablets with the directions 'Take 4 mg and 5 mg on alternating days', but the quantity is missing. You have 1 mg and 3 mg warfarin tablets available to make up the required dose. Assuming that the patient's INR remains stable, what is the exact number of warfarin 3 mg tablets that would be required for a 28-day supply alongside the sufficient supply of 1 mg tablets? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 28
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Determine 3 mg tablets needed per dose** <br />
    To minimize the total tablet count, the 3 mg strength is used as the base. <br />
    - On 4 mg days: One 3 mg tablet + One 1 mg tablet are required. <br />
    - On 5 mg days: One 3 mg tablet + Two 1 mg tablets are required. <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate for the 28-day period (14 days of each dose)** <br />
    - 3 mg tablets for 4 mg days: 1 tablet x 14 days = 14 tablets. <br />
    - 3 mg tablets for 5 mg days: 1 tablet x 14 days = 14 tablets. <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Calculate total 3 mg tablets** <br />
