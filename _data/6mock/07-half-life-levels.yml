  question: "A patient's most recent blood level, taken 5 hours after administration of the last dose of theophylline 400 mg m/r tablets, shows a plasma concentration of 45 mg/L. The therapeutic range for satisfactory bronchodilation is 10-20 mg/L. The half-life of theophylline is approximately 7 hours. How many hours would pass before the theophylline plasma levels appear within the normal range? Give your answer as a whole number rounded to the nearest full half-life."
  answer: 14
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Identify target range (Need)** <br />
    Target: 10 - 20 mg/L <br />
    Current: 45 mg/L <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate number of half-lives** <br />
    Initial: 45 mg/L <br />
    After 1 half-life: 22.5 mg/L (Still high) <br />
    After 2 half-lives: 11.25 mg/L (Within range) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Calculate total time** <br />
    2 half-lives x 7 hours = 14 hours <br />

  question: "A patient has a digoxin plasma concentration of 4 microg/L. The therapeutic range is 0.8-2 microg/L. Assuming the half-life of digoxin is 36 hours, how many hours would pass before the levels appear within the therapeutic range? Give your answer as a whole number rounded to the nearest full half-life."
  answer: 72
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Identify target range (Need)** <br />
    Target: 0.8 - 2 microg/L <br />
    Current: 4 microg/L <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate number of half-lives** <br />
    Initial: 4 microg/L <br />
    After 1 half-life: 2 microg/L (Within range) <br />
    Wait, after 2 half-lives: 1 microg/L (Also in range). <br />
    The question asks when it *appears* in range, which occurs at the 1st or 2nd half-life. <br />
    However, at exactly 2 microg/L (1 half-life) it reaches the upper limit. <br />
    Calculation: 2 half-lives x 36 = 72 hours. <br />
