  question: "A 45-year-old patient weighing 60 kg is admitted with an acute respiratory condition and started on IV aminophylline. The doctor prescribes a loading dose of 6 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion at a rate of 700 microg/kg/hr for 12 hours. What is the total dose of aminophylline in milligrams that the patient will receive over this period? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 864
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Calculate the loading dose (Need)** <br />
    60 kg x 6 mg/kg = 360 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate the maintenance infusion dose (Need)** <br />
    Total microg: 700 microg/kg/hr x 60 kg x 12 hours = 504,000 microg <br />
    Convert to mg: 504,000 / 1,000 = 504 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Calculate the total dose** <br />
    Total = 360 mg (loading) + 504 mg (maintenance) = 864 mg <br />

  question: "A 33-year-old patient weighing 52 kg is prescribed a dopamine infusion to manage low blood pressure. The protocol requires a loading dose of 5 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion at a rate of 400 microg/kg/hr for 12 hours. What is the total dose of dopamine in milligrams that the patient will receive? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 510
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Calculate the loading dose (Need)** <br />
    52 kg x 5 mg/kg = 260 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate the maintenance infusion dose (Need)** <br />
    Total microg: 400 microg/kg/hr x 52 kg x 12 hours = 249,600 microg <br />
    Convert to mg: 249,600 / 1,000 = 249.6 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Calculate the total dose** <br />
    Total = 260 mg + 249.6 mg = 509.6 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Answer:** 510 (Rounded to the nearest whole number)

  question: "An 82-year-old patient weighing 60 kg is started on IV aminophylline therapy. The clinician requests a loading dose of 6 mg/kg followed by a maintenance infusion at a rate of 800 microg/kg/hr for 24 hours. What is the total dose of aminophylline in milligrams that the patient will receive over this 24-hour period? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 1512
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Calculate the loading dose (Need)** <br />
    60 kg x 6 mg/kg = 360 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate the maintenance infusion dose (Need)** <br />
    Total microg: 800 microg/kg/hr x 60 kg x 24 hours = 1,152,000 microg <br />
    Convert to mg: 1,152,000 / 1,000 = 1,152 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Calculate the total dose** <br />
    Total = 360 mg + 1,152 mg = 1,512 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Answer:** 1512
