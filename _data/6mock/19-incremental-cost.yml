  question: "A new drug to treat children with cystic fibrosis has been released (Drug B). The existing drug (Drug A) increases the predicted forced expiratory volume (FEV1) by an average of 2.0% compared to placebo, at an annual cost of £48,000. Drug B increases the FEV1 by an average of 3.5% compared to placebo and costs £63,000 per year. What is the cost (in pounds) of each additional 1% FEV1 with Drug B compared to Drug A? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 10000
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Calculate the incremental cost** <br />
    £63,000 (Drug B) - £48,000 (Drug A) = £15,000 <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate the incremental benefit** <br />
    3.5% (Drug B) - 2.0% (Drug A) = 1.5% <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Calculate cost per additional 1% benefit** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Incremental Cost}}{\text{Incremental Benefit}} \): <br />

  question: "A health board is reviewing two drugs for diabetes management. Drug A reduces HbA1c levels by 0.8% and costs £400 per year. Drug B reduces HbA1c by 1.2% and costs £1,000 per year. What is the cost (in pounds) for each additional 0.1% reduction in HbA1c achieved by using Drug B instead of Drug A? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 150
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Calculate the incremental cost** <br />
    £1,000 - £400 = £600 <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate the incremental benefit** <br />

  question: "Two antihypertensive agents are being reviewed by a formulary committee. Agent A reduces diastolic blood pressure by an average of 8 mmHg at an annual cost of £100. Agent B reduces diastolic blood pressure by an average of 18 mmHg at an annual cost of £400. What is the cost (in pounds) for each additional 1 mmHg reduction achieved by using Agent B instead of Agent A? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 30
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Calculate the incremental cost** <br />
    £400 - £100 = £300 <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate the incremental benefit** <br />
    18 mmHg - 8 mmHg = 10 mmHg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Calculate cost per additional 1 mmHg benefit** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Incremental Cost}}{\text{Incremental Benefit}} \): <br />
    \( \frac{£300}{10 \text{ mmHg}} = £30 \) <br />

  question: "A new lipid-lowering medication (Drug B) is compared to the current standard (Drug A). Drug A reduces LDL cholesterol by an average of 15% at an annual cost of £200. Drug B reduces LDL cholesterol by an average of 35% at an annual cost of £1,200. What is the cost (in pounds) of each additional 1% reduction in LDL cholesterol achieved by using Drug B instead of Drug A? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 50
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Calculate the incremental cost** <br />
    £1,200 (Drug B) - £200 (Drug A) = £1,000 <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate the incremental benefit** <br />
    35% (Drug B) - 15% (Drug A) = 20% <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Calculate cost per additional 1% benefit** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Incremental Cost}}{\text{Incremental Benefit}} \): <br />
    \( \frac{£1,000}{20} = £50 \) <br />

  question: "A new analgesic for chronic lower back pain (Drug B) is evaluated against a generic standard (Drug A). On a 10-point pain scale, Drug A provides an average reduction of 2 points at a cost of £500 per year. Drug B provides an average reduction of 6 points at a cost of £2,500 per year. What is the cost (in pounds) for each additional 1-point reduction in pain achieved with Drug B? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 500
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Calculate the incremental cost** <br />
    £2,500 - £500 = £2,000 <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate the incremental benefit** <br />
    6 points - 2 points = 4 points <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Calculate cost per additional 1 point reduction** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Incremental Cost}}{\text{Incremental Benefit}} \): <br />
    \( \frac{£2,000}{4 \text{ points}} = £500 \) <br />

  question: "A new antihistamine (Drug B) is compared to an existing treatment (Drug A) for the management of seasonal allergies. Drug A provides an average of 10 symptom-free days per month at a cost of £100 per course. Drug B provides an average of 20 symptom-free days per month at a cost of £400 per course. What is the cost (in pounds) for each additional symptom-free day provided by Drug B? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 30
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Calculate the incremental cost** <br />
    £400 - £100 = £300 <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate the incremental benefit** <br />
    20 days - 10 days = 10 days <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Calculate cost per additional symptom-free day** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Incremental Cost}}{\text{Incremental Benefit}} \): <br />
    \( \frac{£300}{10 \text{ days}} = £30 \) <br />

  question: "A new medication for osteoporosis (Drug B) is launched. The existing drug (Drug A) increases bone mineral density by an average of 5% over two years at a cost of £1,000. Drug B increases bone mineral density by an average of 15% over the same period at a cost of £6,000. What is the cost (in pounds) of each additional 1% increase in bone mineral density achieved with Drug B? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 500
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Calculate the incremental cost** <br />
    £6,000 - £1,000 = £5,000 <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate the incremental benefit** <br />
    15% - 5% = 10% <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Calculate cost per additional 1% benefit** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Incremental Cost}}{\text{Incremental Benefit}} \): <br />
    \( \frac{£5,000}{10} = £500 \) <br />

  question: "A clinical study compares two asthma management plans. Plan A reduces the number of severe exacerbations by 1 per year at a cost of £300. Plan B reduces the number of severe exacerbations by 4 per year at a cost of £2,100. What is the cost (in pounds) for each additional exacerbation prevented by using Plan B? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 600
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Calculate the incremental cost** <br />
    £2,100 - £300 = £1,800 <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate the incremental benefit** <br />
    4 exacerbations - 1 exacerbation = 3 exacerbations <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Calculate cost per additional exacerbation prevented** <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Incremental Cost}}{\text{Incremental Benefit}} \): <br />
    \( \frac{£1,800}{3 \text{ episodes}} = £600 \) <br />
    <br />
