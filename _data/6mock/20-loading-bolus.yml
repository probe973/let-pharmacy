  question: "A 68-year-old patient weighing 72 kg is admitted with a suspected acute ischaemic stroke. The prescribed dose of alteplase is 900 microg/kg, with the initial 15% of the dose to be given as an intravenous bolus and the remainder as an infusion. The pharmacy prepares a 1 mg/mL alteplase solution. How many millilitres should be administered for the initial intravenous bolus injection? Give your answer to one decimal place."
  answer: 9.7
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Calculate the total dose (Need)** <br />
    Total microg = 72 kg x 900 microg/kg = 64,800 microg <br />
    Total mg = 64,800 / 1,000 = 64.8 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate the bolus dose (initial 15%)** <br />
    Bolus mg = 64.8 mg x 0.15 = 9.72 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \)** <br />
    \( \frac{9.72 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ mg}} \times 1 \text{ mL} = 9.72 \text{ mL} \) <br />

  question: "A 75-year-old patient weighing 82 kg is prescribed alteplase at a dose of 900 microg/kg for thrombolysis. The clinical protocol specifies that 10% of the total dose is given as an initial stat injection, with the rest given as an infusion. The nurses have a 2 mg/mL solution available. How many millilitres of alteplase are required for the initial injection? Give your answer to one decimal place."
  answer: 3.7
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Calculate the total dose (Need)** <br />
    Total microg = 82 kg x 900 microg/kg = 73,800 microg <br />
    Total mg = 73,800 / 1,000 = 73.8 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate the bolus dose (initial 10%)** <br />
    Bolus mg = 73.8 mg x 0.10 = 7.38 mg <br />

  question: "A 42-year-old patient weighing 55 kg is prescribed alteplase 900 microg/kg for an acute stroke. The consultant requests that the initial 12% of the dose is administered as an intravenous injection. If the pharmacy provides a 1 mg/mL solution, what volume in millilitres should be administered for the initial injection? Give your answer to one decimal place."
  answer: 5.9
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Calculate the total dose (Need)** <br />
    Total microg = 55 kg x 900 microg/kg = 49,500 microg <br />
    Total mg = 49,500 / 1,000 = 49.5 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate the dose for intravenous injection (initial 12%)** <br />
    Injection mg = 49.5 mg x 0.12 = 5.94 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \)** <br />
    \( \frac{5.94 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ mg}} \times 1 \text{ mL} = 5.94 \text{ mL} \) <br />

  question: "A 68-year-old patient weighing 68 kg is admitted for thrombolysis. The prescribed dose is 900 microg/kg, with 7.5% of the dose to be given by initial intravenous injection. The available solution has a concentration of 2 mg/mL. How many millilitres should be given for the initial injection? Give your answer to one decimal place."
  answer: 2.3
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Calculate the total dose (Need)** <br />
    Total microg = 68 kg x 900 microg/kg = 61,200 microg <br />
    Total mg = 61,200 / 1,000 = 61.2 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate the dose for intravenous injection (initial 7.5%)** <br />
    Injection mg = 61.2 mg x 0.075 = 4.59 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \)** <br />
    \( \frac{4.59 \text{ mg}}{2 \text{ mg}} \times 1 \text{ mL} = 2.295 \text{ mL} \) <br />

  question: "A patient weighing 102 kg is prescribed a thrombolytic at a weight-based dose of 900 microg/kg. The clinical guidelines for this specific trial require 25% of the dose to be given by initial intravenous injection. The drug is supplied at a concentration of 5 mg/mL. What volume in millilitres is required for this initial injection? Give your answer to one decimal place."
  answer: 4.6
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Calculate the total dose (Need)** <br />
    Total microg = 102 kg x 900 microg/kg = 91,800 microg <br />
    Total mg = 91,800 / 1,000 = 91.8 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate the dose for intravenous injection (initial 25%)** <br />
    Injection mg = 91.8 mg x 0.25 = 22.95 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \)** <br />
    \( \frac{22.95 \text{ mg}}{5 \text{ mg}} \times 1 \text{ mL} = 4.59 \text{ mL} \) <br />
    <br />

  question: "A 50-year-old patient weighing 45 kg is prescribed a thrombolytic at 800 microg/kg. The directions state that 18% of the dose must be given by initial intravenous injection. If the nurses provide a 1 mg/mL solution, how many millilitres are administered in the initial injection? Give your answer to one decimal place."
  answer: 6.5
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Calculate the total dose (Need)** <br />
    Total microg = 45 kg x 800 microg/kg = 36,000 microg <br />
    Total mg = 36,000 / 1,000 = 36 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate the dose for intravenous injection (initial 18%)** <br />
    Injection mg = 36 mg x 0.18 = 6.48 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \)** <br />
    \( \frac{6.48 \text{ mg}}{1 \text{ mg}} \times 1 \text{ mL} = 6.48 \text{ mL} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Answer:** 6.5 (Rounded to one decimal place)
