    Phase 3: 5 mg = 1 tablet <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Breakdown of the reducing phases** <br />
    Phase 1: 3 tablets x 3 days = 9 tablets <br />
    Phase 2: 2 tablets x 3 days = 6 tablets <br />
    Phase 3: 1 tablet x 3 days = 3 tablets <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Calculate total quantity** <br />
    Total = \( 9 + 6 + 3 = 18 \text{ tablets} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Answer:** 18

  question: "A 66-year-old patient is prescribed a very slow-tapering course of prednisolone 5 mg tablets. The directions provided are: 'Take 8 tablets once daily for 14 days, then reduce the dose by 1 tablet every 14 days until finished'. Calculate the exact number of tablets required to complete this course. Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 504
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Breakdown of the reducing phases** <br />
    Phase 1: 8 tablets x 14 days = 112 tablets <br />
    Phase 2: 7 tablets x 14 days = 98 tablets <br />
    Phase 3: 6 tablets x 14 days = 84 tablets <br />
    Phase 4: 5 tablets x 14 days = 70 tablets <br />
    Phase 5: 4 tablets x 14 days = 56 tablets <br />
    Phase 6: 3 tablets x 14 days = 42 tablets <br />
    Phase 7: 2 tablets x 14 days = 28 tablets <br />
    Phase 8: 1 tablet x 14 days = 14 tablets <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate total quantity** <br />
    Total = \( 112 + 98 + 84 + 70 + 56 + 42 + 28 + 14 = 504 \text{ tablets} \) <br />

  question: "A 39-year-old patient is required to follow a reducing prednisolone schedule using 5 mg tablets. The GP has directed: 'Take 25 mg once daily for 2 days, then reduce the daily dose by 5 mg every 2 days until finished'. Calculate the total number of tablets the patient will need to complete the directions. Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 30
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Convert mg doses to tablet counts (using 5 mg tablets)** <br />
    25 mg = 5 tabs; 20 mg = 4 tabs; 15 mg = 3 tabs; 10 mg = 2 tabs; 5 mg = 1 tab. <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Breakdown of the reducing phases** <br />
    Phase 1: 5 tablets x 2 days = 10 tablets <br />
    Phase 2: 4 tablets x 2 days = 8 tablets <br />
    Phase 3: 3 tablets x 2 days = 6 tablets <br />
    Phase 4: 2 tablets x 2 days = 4 tablets <br />
    Phase 5: 1 tablet x 2 days = 2 tablets <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Calculate total quantity** <br />
    Total = \( 10 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 30 \text{ tablets} \) <br />

  question: "A 51-year-old patient is prescribed a reducing course of prednisolone. The directions state: 'Take 50 mg once daily for 5 days, then reduce the daily dose by 10 mg every 5 days until finished'. If the available tablets are 5 mg strength, calculate the exact number of 5 mg tablets needed to complete the course. Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 150
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Convert mg doses to tablet counts (using 5 mg tablets)** <br />
    Phase 1: 50 mg = 10 tablets <br />
    Phase 2: 40 mg = 8 tablets <br />
    Phase 3: 30 mg = 6 tablets <br />
    Phase 4: 20 mg = 4 tablets <br />
    Phase 5: 10 mg = 2 tablets <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Breakdown of the reducing phases** <br />
    Phase 1: 10 tabs x 5 days = 50 <br />
    Phase 2: 8 tabs x 5 days = 40 <br />
    Phase 3: 6 tabs x 5 days = 30 <br />
    Phase 4: 4 tabs x 5 days = 20 <br />
    Phase 5: 2 tabs x 5 days = 10 <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Calculate total quantity** <br />
    Total = \( 50 + 40 + 30 + 20 + 10 = 150 \text{ tablets} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Answer:** 150
