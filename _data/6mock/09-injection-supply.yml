  question: "A patient who weighs 55 kg attends a pre-admission clinic 2 weeks prior to surgery. The patient is found to have moderate anaemia and the doctor prescribes Venofer®. Venofer® is given at a dose of 200 mg three times a week for 2 weeks pre-surgery and is available as a 20 mg/mL injection in 5 mL vials. How many vials of Venofer® should be supplied to complete the course? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 12
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    Total doses: 3 doses per week x 2 weeks = 6 doses <br />
    Total mg needed: 6 doses x 200 mg = 1,200 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Total amount per vial (Have)** <br />
    Using \( \text{Concentration} \times \text{Supplied In} \): <br />
    20 mg/mL x 5 mL = 100 mg per vial <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Calculate total vials** <br />
    Total vials = \( \frac{1,200 \text{ mg}}{100 \text{ mg}} = 12 \text{ vials} \) <br />
