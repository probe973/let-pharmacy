  question: "A patient is prescribed 10 mg of morphine every 6 hours for 5 days following a fall. You hold a 0.4% w/v morphine mixture in your hospital dispensary stock. How many millilitres should you supply in total? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 50
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    Doses per day: 24 / 6 = 4 doses <br />
    Total doses: 4 doses x 5 days = 20 doses <br />
    Total mg needed: 20 doses x 10 mg = 200 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \)** <br />
    0.4% w/v means 0.4 g in 100 ml = 400 mg in 100 ml <br />
    \( \frac{200 \text{ mg}}{400 \text{ mg}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 50 \text{ ml} \) <br />

  answer: 36
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    Doses per day: 24 / 4 = 6 doses <br />

  question: "A patient is prescribed 40 mg of codeine phosphate every 8 hours for 7 days. Stock is 0.4% w/v. How many millilitres should you supply in total? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 210
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    3 x 7 = 21 doses <br />
    21 x 40 mg = 840 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \)** <br />
    0.4% w/v = 400 mg in 100 ml <br />
    \( \frac{840 \text{ mg}}{400 \text{ mg}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 210 \text{ ml} \) <br />

    <br />
    **Step 2: Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \)** <br />
    0.15% w/v = 150 mg in 100 ml <br />

  question: A patient is prescribed 11 mg of morphine every 4 hours for 5 days following
    an unfortunate accident. You hold a 0.6 % w/v mixture in your hospital dispensary
    stock. How many millilitres should you supply in total? Give your answer as a
    whole number.
  answer: 55
  solution: |-
    Doses per day: 6.0 <br />
    Total doses: \( 6.0 \times 5 \text{ days} = 30.0 \) <br />
    Total mg needed: \( 30.0 \times 11 = 330.0 \text{ mg} \) <br />
    <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \) <br />
    0.6 means 600.0 per 100 ml <br />
    \( \frac{330.0 \text{ mg} }{600.0 \text{ mg} } \times 100 \text{ ml} = 55.0 \text{ ml} \) <br />

  question: A patient is prescribed 8 mg of morphine every 6 hours for 11 days following
    an unfortunate accident. You hold a 0.9 % w/v mixture in your hospital dispensary
    stock. How many millilitres should you supply in total? Give your answer as a
    whole number.
  answer: 39
  solution: |-
    Doses per day: 4.0 <br />
    Total doses: \( 4.0 \times 11 \text{ days} = 44.0 \) <br />
    Total mg needed: \( 44.0 \times 8 = 352.0 \text{ mg} \) <br />
    <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \) <br />
    0.9 means 900.0 per 100 ml <br />
    \( \frac{352.0 \text{ mg} }{900.0 \text{ mg} } \times 100 \text{ ml} = 39.11 \text{ ml} \) <br />

  question: A patient is prescribed 7 mg of morphine every 3 hours for 6 days following
    an unfortunate accident. You hold a 0.4 % w/v mixture in your hospital dispensary
    stock. How many millilitres should you supply in total? Give your answer as a
    whole number.
  answer: 84
  solution: |-
    Doses per day: 8.0 <br />
    Total doses: \( 8.0 \times 6 \text{ days} = 48.0 \) <br />
    Total mg needed: \( 48.0 \times 7 = 336.0 \text{ mg} \) <br />
    <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \) <br />
    0.4 means 400.0 per 100 ml <br />
    \( \frac{336.0 \text{ mg} }{400.0 \text{ mg} } \times 100 \text{ ml} = 84.0 \text{ ml} \) <br />

    an unfortunate accident. You hold a 0.9 % w/v mixture in your hospital dispensary
    stock. How many millilitres should you supply in total? Give your answer as a
    whole number.
  answer: 34
  solution: |-
    Doses per day: 4.0 <br />
    Total doses: \( 4.0 \times 7 \text{ days} = 28.0 \) <br />
    Total mg needed: \( 28.0 \times 11 = 308.0 \text{ mg} \) <br />
    <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \) <br />
    0.9 means 900.0 per 100 ml <br />
    \( \frac{308.0 \text{ mg} }{900.0 \text{ mg} } \times 100 \text{ ml} = 34.22 \text{ ml} \) <br />
