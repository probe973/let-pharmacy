  question: "A patient is prescribed 10 mg of morphine every 6 hours for 5 days following a fall. You hold a 0.4% w/v morphine mixture in your hospital dispensary stock. How many millilitres should you supply in total? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 50
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    Doses per day: 24 / 6 = 4 doses <br />
    Total doses: 4 doses x 5 days = 20 doses <br />
    Total mg needed: 20 doses x 10 mg = 200 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \)** <br />
    0.4% w/v means 0.4 g in 100 ml = 400 mg in 100 ml <br />
    \( \frac{200 \text{ mg}}{400 \text{ mg}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 50 \text{ ml} \) <br />

  answer: 36
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    Doses per day: 24 / 4 = 6 doses <br />

  question: "A patient is prescribed 40 mg of codeine phosphate every 8 hours for 7 days. Stock is 0.4% w/v. How many millilitres should you supply in total? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 210
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    3 x 7 = 21 doses <br />
    21 x 40 mg = 840 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \)** <br />
    0.4% w/v = 400 mg in 100 ml <br />
    \( \frac{840 \text{ mg}}{400 \text{ mg}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 210 \text{ ml} \) <br />

  question: "A patient is prescribed 7.5 mg of morphine every 6 hours for 3 days. Stock is 0.15% w/v. How many millilitres should you supply in total? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 60
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    4 x 3 = 12 doses <br />
    12 x 7.5 mg = 90 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \)** <br />
    0.15% w/v = 150 mg in 100 ml <br />
    \( \frac{90 \text{ mg}}{150 \text{ mg}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 60 \text{ ml} \) <br />

  answer: 40
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    2 x 5 = 10 doses <br />
    10 x 10 mg = 100 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \)** <br />
    0.25% w/v = 250 mg in 100 ml <br />
    \( \frac{100 \text{ mg}}{250 \text{ mg}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 40 \text{ ml} \) <br />
