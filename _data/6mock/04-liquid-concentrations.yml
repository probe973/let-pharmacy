  question: "A patient is prescribed 10 mg of morphine every 6 hours for 5 days following a fall. You hold a 0.4% w/v morphine mixture in your hospital dispensary stock. How many millilitres should you supply in total? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 50
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    Doses per day: 24 / 6 = 4 doses <br />
    Total doses: 4 doses x 5 days = 20 doses <br />
    Total mg needed: 20 doses x 10 mg = 200 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \)** <br />
    0.4% w/v means 0.4 g in 100 ml = 400 mg in 100 ml <br />
    \( \frac{200 \text{ mg}}{400 \text{ mg}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 50 \text{ ml} \) <br />

  answer: 36
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    Doses per day: 24 / 4 = 6 doses <br />

  question: "A patient is prescribed 40 mg of codeine phosphate every 8 hours for 7 days. Stock is 0.4% w/v. How many millilitres should you supply in total? Give your answer as a whole number."
  answer: 210
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose (Need)** <br />
    3 x 7 = 21 doses <br />
    21 x 40 mg = 840 mg <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \)** <br />
    0.4% w/v = 400 mg in 100 ml <br />
    \( \frac{840 \text{ mg}}{400 \text{ mg}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 210 \text{ ml} \) <br />

    Doses per day: 3 <br />
    Total doses: \( 3 \times 4 \text{ days} = 12 \) <br />
    Total mg needed: \( 12 \times 6 = 72 \text{ mg} \) <br />
    <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \) <br />
    0.8 means 800 mg per 100 ml <br />
    \( \frac{72 \text{ mg} }{800 \text{ mg} } \times 100 \text{ ml} = 9.0 \text{ ml} \) <br />

  answer: 27
  solution: |-
    Doses per day: 8 <br />
    Total doses: \( 8 \times 4 \text{ days} = 32 \) <br />
    Total mg needed: \( 32 \times 6 = 192 \text{ mg} \) <br />
    <br />
    Using \( \frac{\text{Need}}{\text{Have}} \times \text{Supplied In} \) <br />
    0.7 means 700 mg per 100 ml <br />
    \( \frac{192 \text{ mg} }{700 \text{ mg} } \times 100 \text{ ml} = 27.43 \text{ ml} \) <br />
