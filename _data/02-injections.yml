  question: "A 12-year-old girl weighing 39 kg has been prescribed amoxicillin 50 mg/kg QDS. The displacement volume for the 1000 mg amoxicillin vial is 0.8 mL. Each vial is reconstituted with 20 mL of water for injection. How many millilitres (mL) need to be given for each dose? Give your answer to one decimal place."
  answer: 40.6
  solution: |
    **Step 1:** Dose = 39 kg x 50 mg/kg = 1,950 mg. <br />
    **Step 2:** Conc = 1,000 mg / (20 + 0.8 mL) = 48.077 mg/mL. <br />
    **Step 3:** Vol = 1,950 / 48.077 = 40.56 mL. <br />
    **Answer:** 40.6 mL.
