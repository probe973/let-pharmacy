  question: "A male patient has a prescription for warfarin 1mg tablets with the directions 'Take 4 mg and 5 mg on alternating days', but the quantity is missing. You have 1 mg and 3 mg warfarin tablets available to make up the required dose. Assuming that his INR remains stable, what is the exact number of warfarin 1mg tablets that would be required for a 28-day supply alongside a sufficient supply of 3 mg tablets?"
  answer: 42
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Determine the 1mg tablets needed for each individual dose** <br />
    To minimize the total number of tablets, we use the 3mg strength as the base: <br />
    - On 4mg days: One 3mg tablet + One 1mg tablet (1 x 1mg tablet needed). <br />
    - On 5mg days: One 3mg tablet + Two 1mg tablets (2 x 1mg tablets needed). <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate for the 28-day period (14 days of each dose)** <br />
    - Total for 4mg days: \( 1 \text{ tablet} \times 14 \text{ days} = 14 \) tablets. <br />
    - Total for 5mg days: \( 2 \text{ tablets} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \) tablets. <br />
    <br />
    **Total 1mg tablets required:** \( 14 + 28 = 42 \).

  question: "A female patient is prescribed warfarin with the directions 'Take 2 mg and 3 mg on alternating days'. You have 1 mg and 3 mg tablets available. What is the exact number of warfarin 1mg tablets required for a 28-day supply alongside the necessary 3 mg tablets?"
  answer: 28
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Determine the 1mg tablets needed for each individual dose** <br />
    - On 2mg days: Two 1mg tablets (2 x 1mg tablets needed). <br />
    - On 3mg days: One 3mg tablet (0 x 1mg tablets needed). <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate for the 28-day period (14 days of each dose)** <br />
    - Total for 2mg days: \( 2 \text{ tablets} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \) tablets. <br />
    - Total for 3mg days: \( 0 \text{ tablets} \times 14 \text{ days} = 0 \) tablets. <br />
    <br />
    **Total 1mg tablets required:** \( 28 + 0 = 28 \).

  question: "A 12-year-old girl weighing 39 kg has been prescribed amoxicillin 50 mg/kg QDS for suspected endocarditis. The displacement volume for the 1000 mg amoxicillin vial is 0.8 mL. Each vial needs to be reconstituted with 20 mL of water for injection. How many millilitres of amoxicillin injection need to be given for each prescribed dose? Give your answer to one decimal place."
  answer: 40.6
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Calculate the required dose in mg** <br />
    Weight = 39 kg. Dose = 50 mg/kg. <br />
    \( 39 \text{ kg} \times 50 \text{ mg/kg} = 1,950 \text{ mg per dose.} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 2: Calculate the concentration of the reconstituted vial** <br />
    Vial strength = 1,000 mg. <br />
    Final Volume = Diluent (20 mL) + Displacement Volume (0.8 mL) = 20.8 mL. <br />
    Concentration = \( 1,000 \text{ mg} / 20.8 \text{ mL} = 48.0769 \text{ mg/mL.} \) <br />
    <br />
    **Step 3: Calculate the volume to be administered** <br />
    Volume = Required Dose / Concentration. <br />
    \( 1,950 \text{ mg} / 48.0769 \text{ mg/mL} = 40.5615 \text{ mL.} \) <br />

  question: "A 12 kg baby is prescribed benzylpenicillin 60 mg/kg every 6 hours. A 1.2 g (1200 mg) vial has a displacement volume of 0.8 mL and is reconstituted with 11.2 mL water for injection. Calculate the mL per dose to one decimal place."
  answer: 7.2
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose** = \( 12 \times 60 = 720 \text{ mg.} \) <br />
    **Step 2: Conc** = \( 1,200 / (11.2 + 0.8) = 100 \text{ mg/mL.} \) <br />
    **Step 3: Vol** = \( 720 / 100 = 7.2 \text{ mL.} \) <br />
    **Answer:** 7.2 mL.

  question: "A child weighs 34 kg and is prescribed cefotaxime 50 mg/kg every 8 hours. A 1 g vial (DV 0.6 mL) is reconstituted with 9.4 mL water for injection. Calculate the mL per dose to one decimal place."
  answer: 17.0
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose** = \( 34 \times 50 = 1,700 \text{ mg.} \) <br />
    **Step 2: Conc** = \( 1,000 / 10 = 100 \text{ mg/mL.} \) <br />
    **Step 3: Vol** = \( 1,700 / 100 = 17.0 \text{ mL.} \) <br />
    **Answer:** 17.0 mL.

  question: "A 40 kg patient is prescribed meropenem 15 mg/kg TDS. A 1 g vial (DV 0.8 mL) is reconstituted with 19.2 mL water for injection. Calculate the volume for each dose in mL to one decimal place."
  answer: 12.0
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose** = \( 40 \times 15 = 600 \text{ mg.} \) <br />
    **Step 2: Conc** = \( 1,000 / 20 = 50 \text{ mg/mL.} \) <br />
    **Step 3: Vol** = \( 600 / 50 = 12.0 \text{ mL.} \) <br />
    **Answer:** 12.0 mL.

  question: "A child weighs 28 kg and is prescribed teicoplanin 10 mg/kg. A 400 mg vial (DV 0.2 mL) is reconstituted with 3.8 mL water for injection. Calculate the mL per dose to one decimal place."
  answer: 2.8
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose** = \( 28 \times 10 = 280 \text{ mg.} \) <br />
    **Step 2: Conc** = \( 400 / 4 = 100 \text{ mg/mL.} \) <br />
    **Step 3: Vol** = \( 280 / 100 = 2.8 \text{ mL.} \) <br />
    **Answer:** 2.8 mL.

  question: "A patient weighing 62 kg is prescribed ceftazidime 30 mg/kg TDS. A 2 g (2000 mg) vial (DV 1.2 mL) is reconstituted with 18.8 mL water for injection. How many mL are required per dose? Give your answer to one decimal place."
  answer: 18.6
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose** = \( 62 \times 30 = 1,860 \text{ mg.} \) <br />
    **Step 2: Conc** = \( 2,000 / 20 = 100 \text{ mg/mL.} \) <br />
    **Step 3: Vol** = \( 1,860 / 100 = 18.6 \text{ mL.} \) <br />
    **Answer:** 18.6 mL.

  question: "An 11 kg infant is prescribed flucloxacillin 50 mg/kg QDS. A 250 mg vial (DV 0.2 mL) is reconstituted with 4.8 mL water for injection. Calculate the volume needed per dose in mL. Give your answer to one decimal place."
  answer: 11.0
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose** = \( 11 \times 50 = 550 \text{ mg.} \) <br />
    **Step 2: Conc** = \( 250 / 5 = 50 \text{ mg/mL.} \) <br />
    **Step 3: Vol** = \( 550 / 50 = 11.0 \text{ mL.} \) <br />
    **Answer:** 11.0 mL.

  answer: 20.0
  solution: |
    **Step 1: Dose** = \( 20 \times 50 = 1,000 \text{ mg.} \) <br />
    **Step 2: Conc** = \( 600 / 12 = 50 \text{ mg/mL.} \) <br />
    **Step 3: Vol** = \( 1,000 / 50 = 20.0 \text{ mL.} \) <br />
    **Answer:** 20.0 mL.
